=head1 NAME

p5u - utilities for Perl 5 development and administration

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Hmmm... what version of the HTML::HTML5::Entities module is installed?

 $ p5u version HTML::HTML5::Entities
 HTML::HTML5::Entities
     /opt/perl-5.16.0/lib/site_perl/5.16.0/HTML/HTML5/Entities.pm: 0.003

How is that version doing on CPAN Testers?

 $ p5u testers HTML::HTML5::Entities
 CPAN Testers results for HTML-HTML5-Entities version 0.003
 
                                   PASS  FAIL   ETC

Let's run the HTML-HTML5-Entities test suite against my currently installed
copy of the module

 $ p5u reprove HTML::HTML5::Entities
 Reproving HTML-HTML5-Entities/0.003 (TOBYINK)
 t/01basic.t ..... ok   
 t/02encoding.t .. ok   
 t/03decoding.t .. ok   
 All tests successful.
 Files=3, Tests=16,  1 wallclock secs
     ( 0.14 usr  0.02 sys +  0.65 cusr  0.02 csys =  0.83 CPU)
 Result: PASS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

p5u is a command-line tool which provides a handful of helpful utilities
for Perl development and administration. For example, reporting on what
versions of a module are installed locally; which are available on CPAN;
how the versions compare on the CPAN Testers service, and so on.

This is an early version, so the number of utilities provided is fairly
limited, but will grow. Thanks to L<App::Cmd>, p5u has a modular
architecture, so you can write your own P5U plugins, and publish them
on CPAN.

For a list of supported commands, run:

 p5u commands

For help on a particular command, e.g. the "testers" command, run:

 p5u help testers

Most commands also have abbreviated names, so you can run "p5u ct" instead
of the longer "p5u testers". To reveal a list of these aliases, run:

 p5u aliases

To see the version numbers and authors of your p5u commands, run:
